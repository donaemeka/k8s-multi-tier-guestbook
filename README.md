## Kubernetes Guestbook Application

 This is a project I built to get hands-on experience with deploying a multi-tier application on Kubernetes. It is a simple guestbook App where 
 
 users can leave a message, but underneath, it's packed with core DevOps concepts like container orchestration, service discovery, and database replication.


## Project Structure

This repository is kept simple and focused. The main file is all you need to deploy the entire application.

## What's Inside?

In simple terms, this project has three main parts:

## The Website (Frontend): 

- A PHP application that users see in their browser. It's designed to scale out by adding more pods if the site gets busy.

- The Primary Database (Redis Leader): This is the only pod that can write new data. When you submit a message, it goes here first.

## The Read-Replica Databases (Redis Followers): 

- These pods are copies of the main database. Their job is to handle everyone reading the guestbook messages, which takes load off the leader and makes the app faster.

## The magic of Kubernetes is how it keeps all these parts talking to each other reliably.



## Why I Built This

I wanted to move from just reading about Kubernetes to actually deploying something real. This project helped me understand:

- How to define deployments and services in YAML.

- How different components in a cluster discover and talk to each other.

- The practical use of a leader-follower pattern for databases.

- How to troubleshoot real-world issues like missing images and port conflicts.



## Challenges I Ran Into (And How I Fixed Them)

This was not all smooth sailing! Here are a few hiccups I had along the way:

## The Missing Docker Image: 

-The tutorial used an image (gcr.io/google-samples/guestbook-php-redis:1.0) that I could not pull. My pods were stuck in ImagePullBackOff error.

My Solution:

- I built my own Docker image for the PHP frontend and published it to my Docker Hub account (donaemeka/fancy-app:latest). Then I just updated the YAML file to use my image. Problem solved!

## "Port 8080 is already in use":

- When I tried to forward the port to my browser, my terminal yelled at me.

My Solution: 

- I learned the lsof -i :8080 command to find the process that was hogging the port and then free it up. It was a great lesson in basic system troubleshooting.

## Understanding the "Why": At first, I did not get why we needed separate Redis pods for leader and follower.

My Solution: 

- I did some reading and realized it is a classic pattern: having one dedicated writer prevents conflicts and makes the app consistent, while 
multiple readers make it scalable. It finally clicked!



## What I Learned

This project was a huge step forward for me. I got practical experience with:

- Kubernetes Fundamentals: Deployments, Pods, Services (ClusterIP), and kubectl commands.

- Design Patterns: Implementing and understanding the leader-follower pattern for stateful workloads.

- Troubleshooting: Debugging ImagePullBackOff, examining pod logs, and describing resources to find issues.

- Resilience: Seeing how Kubernetes automatically restarts containers and keeps the application available.



## Quick Start: Run It Yourself

If you have a Kubernetes cluster (like Minikube or Docker Desktop), you can run this yourself:


# Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/donaemeka/k8s-multi-tier-guestbook.git


cd k8s-multi-tier-guestbook

# Deploy everything

kubectl apply -f guestbook-all-in-one.yaml


# Check that the pods are running

kubectl get pods


# Forward a port to your local machine

kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8080:80

Then, just open http://localhost:8080 in your browser!

## Let's Connect!

I am actively looking for junior DevOps or platform engineering opportunities where I can learn, contribute, and grow.
